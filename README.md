This is an Web application that our team (Adrian Rus, Allan Williamson and Brian McDonnell) have built as a final Project for our Web Design course in NCI.

We have built this app after checking the market needs, we have built a persona and we have designed this website to fullfill our Persona needs.

It has been built using PyCharm IDE.

Technologies used were:

	- HTML5,
	- CSS3 
	- and jQuery 
	- we also used some basic validation in JavaScript for our forms.

In order to test it and check it is a functional app it has been deployed on #Firebase#.
#Website is live# now 29/01/2017.
